problemsToDo:

ðŸ’¡. when we use and between two condition it return false if the first one is false and do not check the secon at all 
    but when the first condition is true it will check for second .

    
1. INORDER SUCCESSOR OF BST AND BT
2. SWAP THE NODE IN LINKED LIST BY NODES
3. IMPLEMENT CIRCULAR QUEUE
4. ROTATE MATRIX ELEMENT ANTICLOCKWISE BY ONE 
5. CHECK A GIVEN BST HAS ONLY ONLY CHILD FOR ALL NODES EXCEPT LEAF NODE
6. REPLACE EACH NODE OF A BINARY TREE WITH THE SUM OF ITS INORDER PREDECESSOR AND SUCCESSOR
7. SEE ONE MORE TIME THE CIRCULAR QUEUE
8. IS A GIVEN BINARY TREE IS HEAP
9. MERGE K SORTED ARRAY WITH ARRAY AND WITH HEAPS ALSO 
10. MERGE TWO SORTED LINKED LIST JUST BY SPLICING THE NODES, ie. we have to change the pointer of the twon linked list such that they come in sorted order.
11. DEPTH IN FIRST SEARCH OF GRAPH ITERATIVE WAY.
